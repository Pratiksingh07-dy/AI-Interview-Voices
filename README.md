> An AI-powered interview preparation platform where users practice technical interviews using **voice input**, receive **intelligent NLP-based feedback**, and track their **performance over time**.

---

## 💡 Motivation

Most people who struggle in interviews aren't unprepared — they just haven't practiced *speaking their answers out loud* to something that feels real.

Practicing with a friend is helpful, but you can't do it anytime you want. Reading answers from a textbook is different from actually articulating them under pressure. And the hardest part? **Learning to speak confidently to a screen, when you can't even tell if anyone is really listening.**

I built this platform because I felt that gap myself. The moment you sit in front of a digital device in an interview — no body language from the interviewer, no nods, no reactions — it's a completely different experience. Most people have never practiced for *that* specific scenario.

**AI Interview System** is my attempt to fix that — a platform where anyone can practice technical interviews, speak their answers out loud, and get real feedback, anytime, without needing another person on the other side.

## 🚀 Features

### 🎤 Voice-Based Answering
- Answer questions using your microphone — just like a real interview
- Real-time speech-to-text conversion

### 🧠 AI Answer Evaluation
- Powered by **Sentence Transformers (MiniLM)** for deep semantic understanding
- Evaluates answers using a combination of keyword matching and semantic similarity
- Returns a **score out of 10**, matched keywords, missing concepts, and actionable feedback

### 🧪 Practice Mode
- Instant feedback on every answer
- Ideal answer shown immediately after submission
- Best for quick learning and concept reinforcement

### 🎯 Interview Mode
- Simulates a real interview experience end-to-end
- Structured 5-question flow with no mid-way feedback
- Final performance summary shown at the end

### 👤 User Authentication
- Signup and login system
- User data persisted in backend storage

### 📊 Performance History
- Tracks all previous interview attempts per user
- Displays subject, score, and date for every session

## ⚙️ How It Works

```
User selects subject (ML, OS, DBMS, etc.)
        │
        ▼
Backend fetches question from question bank
        │
        ▼
User answers via voice input (speech-to-text)
        │
        ▼
Answer is cleaned & processed
        │
        ├── Keyword Matching
        └── Semantic Similarity (MiniLM)
        │
        ▼
AI generates Score + Feedback + Missing Concepts
        │
        ▼
Result saved to user's performance history
```

## 🌟 Key Highlights

- Built entirely **self-initiated** — not a college assignment, a real problem worth solving
- Combines **Full Stack Development + NLP + Voice Interaction** in one project
- Evaluation goes beyond keyword matching — uses actual **semantic understanding**
- Designed to simulate the discomfort of speaking to a screen, which is what real interviews feel like
